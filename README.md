# Project 1: Exploring Decision Tree Classifier

This project explores the fundamentals of Decision Tree Classifiers using the Car Evaluation Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The notebook demonstrates building, evaluating, visualizing, and optimizing a Decision Tree model for multi-class classification, predicting car acceptability based on attributes like buying price, maintenance cost, doors, persons, luggage boot size, and estimated safety.

# Project 2: Box Office Revenue Prediction

This project uses pre-existing movie data to predict the opening week revenue of Avatar: Fire and Ash in the US. Using historical data from 2009 to 2025, the model accounts for critical factors such as budget, cast star power, franchise status, and the significant market shift caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The project was completed on December 15, 2025, 4 days before the release.

The predicted first-week revenue stands at **$225,141,318.20**.

# Project 3: Exploring Neural Network (MLP)
This project presents a comprehensive comparison between Decision Tree and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network classifiers applied to the UCI Car Evaluation dataset. It picks up where Project 1 is left off and implements an MLP classifier on the same dataset. Both models are rigorously evaluated using multiple metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC scores across 10-fold cross-validation. The notebook provides detailed explanations of neural network concepts, training dynamics (loss curves), and the trade-offs between model interpretability and performance. With both models achieving ~97% accuracy on the 4-class car evaluation task (unacceptable, acceptable, good, very good), the analysis concludes with practical recommendations.
