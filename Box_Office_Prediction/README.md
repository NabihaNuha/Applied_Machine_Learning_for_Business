# **Project Overview**


This project leverages machine learning to predict the Opening Week Revenue of movies based on pre-release metadata. By analyzing historical data from 2009 to 2025, the model accounts for critical factors such as budget, cast star power, franchise status, and the significant market shift caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The final model is designed to estimate box office performance for upcoming releases using pre-release features.


The folder contains:

* Fact table (Daily box office data)
* Dimension table (Additional features for prediction)
* Prediction model (including EDA, Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning and Best Model)

The datasets extracted and used in this project are all available in the following Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CGGstHDXtZ6C-nizpDTNQv9AvjdHgf1Y?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR6TNVkIcPDl5_2aPXe08x0Jrud2DXc4Uqebvl1LxBfA_WcfyTPla9F9WTX4gA_aem_wRBYj915lkY4EH2cp0ihaw
